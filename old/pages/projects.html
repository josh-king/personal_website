    <p class="under_wrapper">
        Revision is a Hacked <a href="//minecraft.net">Minecraft client</a> that I wrote. It features a fully working event dispatch system for implementing code into the runtime as well as a debug system that maintains any errors that occur and 'ping' them to the user.

        <b><a href="">NotBotAPI</a></b> (c. 2017)
        <p>Latest Version: 1.3.2</p>
    </h2>
    <p class="under_wrapper">
        NotBot is a player simulation bot that is used for OldSchool Runescape botting that simulates a normal players actions between actions. At the moment it is only available for the <a href="//www.runemate.com/botstore/">Runemate Spectre</a> client. The NotBotAPI requires the user to first 'record' themselves performing the action for a minimum of 10 minutes so that the program can create a unique user profile. The longer the user records themself performing the action the more lifelike the program becomes.

        <b><a href="">TrueAgility</a></b> (c. 2017)

    </h2>
    <p class="under_wrapper">
        TrueAgility is an OldSchool Runescape botting program that runs on the <a href="//www.runemate.com/botstore/">Runemate Spectre</a> client. TrueAgility simulates the player performing the Agility actions with accuracy for max xp/hr. TrueAgility implements the NotBotAPI to hide from the botting checks that are in place with Runescape.

    </h2>
    <p class="under_wrapper">
        Asterfield is a small side project I worked on back in 2015 exploring if I could create <b>'space-like' physics</b> using math. I then turned it into a full game however got tied up with other projects at College and had to stop developing it. You can still play test a <b>demo</b> version, the completed features are; Key events, position translation, '<i>floaty</i>' physics, boost meter and image processing.

    <p class="under_wrapper">
        I wrote an essay on the concepts of object orientated programming within Java a couple of years back. Although it's examples are centered around Java it's still adaptable to other programming languages.

    <p class="under_wrapper">
        My github has a couple of projects available for viewing - there is only a few on there at the moment, but I am slowly updating it and adding old projects from the past. Most of them will be <i>Java</i> as it is my main programming language, but I am slowly branching out to other languages as per my need for them.
